# week-8-python-assignment
Introduction
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. We'll clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis, generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection**  
    - Source: Publicly available COVID-19 datasets.
    - Tools: Pandas for data loading and initial inspection.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
    - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
    - Normalizing and transforming data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
    - Statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover trends.
    - Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive plots.

4. **Insights and Observations**  
    - Key findings from the data analysis.
    - Comparisons across countries and time periods.

5. **Visualizations**  
    - Line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps to represent trends.
    - Focus on cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress.

6. **Conclusion**  
    - Summary of findings and potential implications.
    - Suggestions for further analysis or research.
